phosphor
========

Phosphor is a JS UI framework for making retro, CRT, green-screen, monochrome menu systems. Because we can.

Features:
* Big slow-blinking cursor.
* Choose from a variety of screen templates out of the box.
* Choose any of green, blue, amber, red or white phorsphorical colors.
* Includes a bunch of wipe effects like : screen flicker, scanlines and on/off.

Caveats:
* Only supports Google Chrome. (why target anything else?)
* Built with the help of jQuery 1.9.1.
